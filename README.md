# PrepPlot
A loose collections of functions to prepare plots in R

I mainly created this package for documenting my work on radar-/spider-plots. However I will add more functions which I used to create certain data-objects for plotting. There is also a folder with examples. 

Concerning radar-plots there is currently three examples I came up. You can choose between a ![polygon grid](https://github.com/region-spotteR/MyDocuments/tree/master/screenshots/spider_chart.png?raw=true "Optional title") or a ![circular one](https://github.com/region-spotteR/MyDocuments/tree/master/screenshots/circular_radar.png "Optional title"). There is even a working example in ![shiny and plotly](https://github.com/region-spotteR/MyDocuments/tree/master/screenshots/Shiny1.png "Optional title")
