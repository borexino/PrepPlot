# PrepPlot

I mainly created this package for documenting my work on radar-/spider-plots. However I will add more functions which I used to create certain data-objects for plotting. There is also a folder with examples. 

Installation: Since I haven't yet figured out `devtools` github install, use Ms Parker's description on [how to install a custom R-package][1]

Concerning radar-plots there are currently three examples (cf. the corresponding example-folder):
1.  You can choose between a polygon grid or a circular grid:

2.  There is even a working example with Shiny and Plotly:
