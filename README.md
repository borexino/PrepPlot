# PrepPlot
A loose collections of functions to prepare plots in R

I mainly created this package for documenting my work on radar-/spider-plots. However I will add more functions which I used to create certain data-objects for plotting. There is also a folder with examples. 

Concerning radar-plots there is currently three examples I came up. 
1.  You can choose between a polygon grid:

2.  Or a circular grid:

3.  There is even a working example in Shiny and Plotly:
