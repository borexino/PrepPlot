This folder contains different radar implimentations

Instructions: 
  1.  First run the first chunk in shiny_example.Rmd
  2.  Then either 
         -  use the plotly implementation in the same file or 
         -  run on of the 'gg_'-named ggplot2-examples

If you want to remove the optional code-parts: I usually added a letter to my code-snippet-number if the code is optional for a certain type of radar. In addition every code piece is thoroughly commented.
